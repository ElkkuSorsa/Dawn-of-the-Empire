 GER_reichtag.1.d: "The various national minorities within the German Empire have a exemption from conscription, a policy that has long been a point of contention for German nationalists. With the recent upheavals in Austria and the rise of nationalist movements across Europe, there is a growing call to end these exemptions and ensure that all citizens of the Empire share equally in the responsibilities of citizenship. The reichtag is considering the amendment of the conscription laws to remove these exemptions, a move that is likely to be met with both support and opposition from different factions within the Empire.\n\nThe reichstag is now debating the proposed §YMinority Conscription Act§! which would end the exemptions for national minorities. Supporters argue that this is a necessary step towards national unity and equality, while opponents fear it could lead to unrest and further alienate minority communities."
