 GER_diet.1.d: "Kaiser Wilhelm II has called for the Imperial Diet to be re-convened in order to discuss the future of the Holy Roman Empire. The Diet will be made up of representatives from all parts of the empire, including Austria, Bohemia, and the various German states. The Diet will have the power to make decisions on matters such as foreign policy, military affairs, and economic policy. The Diet will also have the power to approve or reject any proposed changes to the constitution of the empire, but now the main problem is the so called Austrian question. The Austrian part of the empire still is under the German kingdom and thus not a constituent kingdom."
 GER_diet.2.d: "After the great economic crash of 1931, the empire's economy has been in a state of turmoil. The Great Depression has led to widespread unemployment and poverty, and many people are struggling to make ends meet. The government has been forced to implement austerity measures in order to try and stabilize the economy, but these measures have only served to make things worse for the average citizen. The economic situation has also led to increased political instability, with many people turning to extremist parties in search of solutions. The upcoming elections will be crucial in determining the future direction of the empire, as the people will have to decide whether to support the current government or to turn to more radical alternatives."
 GER_diet.3.d: "A representative of the German army has informed the the military is in a state of disarray due to lack of funding and resources. The army is struggling to maintain its readiness and effectiveness, and many soldiers are demoralized and disillusioned. The government has been forced to make cuts to the military budget in order to try and address the economic crisis, but these cuts have only served to further weaken the army. The military leadership is calling for increased funding and support in order to restore the army to its former strength, but it remains to be seen whether the government will be willing or able to provide the necessary resources. The military situation is a cause for concern, as the empire faces potential threats from both internal and external sources."
